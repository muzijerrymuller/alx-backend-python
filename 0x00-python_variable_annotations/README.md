Basic Type Annotations:

Task 0 (add function): Teaches how to annotate function arguments and return types using basic types like float.
Task 1 (concat function): Demonstrates string concatenation and how to specify that arguments are of type str and the return type is also a str.
Using math functions with annotations:

Task 2 (floor function): Shows how to use external libraries (like math) and annotate the input as float while specifying that the return type is an int.
String conversion with type annotations:

Task 3 (to_str function): Teaches converting a float to its string representation and annotating both the input and return types.
Defining and annotating variables:

Task 4: Introduces how to annotate variables with explicit types (int, float, bool, str), which enhances code readability and prevents type-related issues.
Complex types and Lists:

Task 5 (sum_list function): Demonstrates how to handle lists of floats and annotate them using typing.List[float].
Task 6 (sum_mixed_list function): Expands the knowledge to work with lists containing both int and float, using typing.Union.
Annotating Tuples:

Task 7 (to_kv function): Explains how to work with tuples, showing how to annotate mixed types in a tuple (a str and a squared value as float).
Returning Functions:

Task 8 (make_multiplier function): Shows how to annotate functions that return other functions (higher-order functions), introducing Callable in the annotations.
Duck Typing and Iterables:

Task 9 (element_length function): Covers more advanced annotations, showing how to annotate a function that works with any iterable and returns a list of tuples, using typing.Iterable, typing.Sequence, and typing.Tuple.
