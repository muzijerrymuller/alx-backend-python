"""
Converts a floating-point number to its string representation.

This function takes a floating-point number as an argument and
converts it to a string format. The conversion is achieved using
the built-in `str()` function, which returns the string version
of the given float. This can be particularly useful for
formatting output or for use in string concatenation.
